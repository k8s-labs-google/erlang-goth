### Pre-Check ###

- If you are filing for a bug, please do a quick search in current issues first
- For bugs, mention if you are willing or interested in helping fix the issue
- For questions or support, it helps to include context around your project or problem
- Think of a descriptive title (more descriptive than 'feature X is broken' unless it is fully broken)

### Current behaviour ###

Describe the current behaviour. In case of a failure, crash, or exception, please include the result of running the command with debug information:

```
DEBUG=1 rebar3 <my failing command>
```

### Expected behaviour ###

Describe what you expected to happen.
